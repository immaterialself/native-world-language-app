Native World Language App
Tānisi, nitotēmak.
Hello, my friends.

Welcome to the Native World Language App, a living project dedicated to preserving and sharing Indigenous languages, cultures, and stories from around the world—beginning with the languages of Turtle Island. This project aims to create an accessible platform that highlights the voices, teachings, and histories of Indigenous peoples from the West Coast to the East Coast, and from the top of the pole to the bottom.

About the Project
This app isn’t just about language—it’s about reclaiming our voice, remembering ancient teachings, and passing on the strength of our ancestors. Through audio, visual stories, traditional teachings, and the realities of what we’ve endured—and still endure—we aim to create a space where Indigenous cultures can be shared, celebrated, and preserved for generations to come.

The Native World Language App will include content from Indigenous languages and cultures across the globe, starting with Cree and expanding to other languages spoken across Turtle Island. The goal is to provide a dynamic, open-source resource that is inclusive and accessible to all.

Why This App?
As an Indigenous person of Cree and Maya Lenca descent, this project is deeply personal to me. It’s a journey of learning, understanding, and sharing the rich cultural heritage that is often overlooked in mainstream society. This app is about more than just preserving language; it’s about honoring the teachings of our elders and ensuring that future generations can connect with their cultural roots.

This app will be a resource to explore Indigenous languages, storytelling, traditional knowledge, and histories from around the world. It's designed to help keep our languages alive and strong, empowering people to learn, share, and grow.
